# PG204 — Ecommerce Order Domain Pack

## 1. Objective

Accelerate commerce project synthesis while preserving money and inventory correctness.

## 2. Scope

This Skill owns the declared transformation and the evidence required to prove it. It cannot mutate approved upstream facts, bypass policy, or convert uncertainty into success.

### In scope

- Validate and consume domain_pack_sdk.
- Validate and consume commerce_requirements.
- Validate and consume payment_and_tax_policies.
- Produce and validate commerce_domain_pack.
- Produce and validate workflow_models.
- Produce and validate integration_contracts.
- Produce and validate test_scenarios.

### Out of scope

- Silent modification of approved requirements, architecture, contracts, security policy, evidence, or certification thresholds.
- Undeclared process, network, repository, secret, deployment, billing, or tenant-administration access.
- Overwriting user-owned artifacts or hiding unresolved conflicts.
- Claiming build, security, compatibility, or delivery success without required evidence.
- Unreviewed self-modification of Skills, templates, models, or Domain Packs.

## 3. Inputs

- `domain_pack_sdk`
- `commerce_requirements`
- `payment_and_tax_policies`

Inputs carry schema version, content fingerprint, tenant/workspace/project identity, provenance, and approval state where applicable.

## 4. Outputs

- `commerce_domain_pack`
- `workflow_models`
- `integration_contracts`
- `test_scenarios`

Outputs are versioned, ownership-classified where relevant, linked into the Artifact Graph, and accompanied by validation and evidence.

## 5. Preconditions

- Tenant, workspace, project, run, and active policy context are resolved.
- Required dependency Skills and schemas are compatible and pinned.
- Input approval, ownership, provenance, and integrity checks pass.
- The caller has the declared capability grant.
- No unresolved upstream critical issue invalidates the operation.

## 6. Workflow

1. Model product, pricing, cart, order, payment intent, shipment, return, and refund concepts.
2. Define order and payment state machines with idempotency.
3. Define inventory, tax, payment, carrier, and notification integration boundaries.
4. Provide failure, duplicate, reconciliation, and compensation tests.
5. Publish reference blueprints.

## 7. Tool and Permission Policy

- Default deny for undeclared tools and capabilities.
- Imported requirements, code, templates, feedback, logs, and marketplace artifacts are untrusted input.
- Reads and writes are limited to declared scope and tenant boundaries.
- Secrets are short-lived references and never copied to generated artifacts or evidence.
- High-impact actions require policy authorization and configured human approval.
- Runtime enforcement, not prompt instruction alone, controls tools and sandboxes.

## 8. Deterministic Constraints

- Stable identities derive from approved namespace and version rules.
- Collections are normalized before hashing, comparison, or generation.
- Skill, schema, policy, model, template, tool, environment, and Domain Pack versions are recorded.
- Identical approved inputs produce no duplicate semantic objects or side effects.
- Probabilistic judgments include evidence, confidence, alternatives, and escalation.
- Retries and resumes preserve idempotency.

## 9. Failure Taxonomy

- `DOUBLE_CHARGE_RISK` — stop unsafe continuation and emit a structured diagnostic.
- `INVENTORY_OVERSELL` — stop unsafe continuation and emit a structured diagnostic.
- `REFUND_STATE_GAP` — stop unsafe continuation and emit a structured diagnostic.
- `CURRENCY_PRECISION_ERROR` — stop unsafe continuation and emit a structured diagnostic.

Standard handling classes: `RETRYABLE`, `INPUT_REQUIRED`, `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`, `POLICY_DENIED`, `CONFLICT`, and `TERMINAL`.

## 10. Retry and Compensation

- Retry only explicitly retryable failures within configured limits.
- Preserve idempotency and correlation identifiers.
- Journal all consequential writes and external side effects.
- Compensate partial derived work without deleting authoritative input, immutable evidence, or user-owned artifacts.
- Stop when recovery would weaken policy, contracts, tests, or certification.
- Exhausted retries produce a terminal diagnostic bundle.

## 11. Generated Artifacts

- Primary outputs listed above.
- Validation, compatibility, coverage, or policy reports.
- Artifact Graph nodes and typed lineage edges.
- Decision, warning, conflict, exception, and approval records.
- Audit events and signed evidence where required.
- Human-readable review summary.

## 12. Evidence Contract

Evidence contains input references and hashes; Skill, schema, policy, model, tool, template, and environment versions; decisions and alternatives; validation results; output fingerprints; warnings, gaps, exceptions, and approvals; and identities of responsible agents, runners, or humans.

No success, safety, compatibility, completeness, certification, or billing claim is valid without matching evidence.

## 13. Security Requirements

- Enforce tenant, project, repository, environment, data, telemetry, and evidence isolation.
- Defend against prompt injection, malicious templates, poisoned feedback, unsafe code, and supply-chain attacks.
- Redact secrets, credentials, tokens, personal data, regulated data, and inaccessible source content.
- Apply deny-by-default authorization and least privilege.
- Preserve append-only audit and decision history.
- Fail closed when critical security context is missing.

## 14. Unit Tests

- Valid approved inputs produce every declared output.
- Missing, stale, incompatible, or unauthorized input fails before consequential writes.
- Equivalent reordered input preserves stable identities and semantic results.
- Repeated execution with the same idempotency key does not duplicate artifacts or side effects.
- Every inferred judgment includes source evidence and confidence.
- Output schema and semantic validation reject dangling or contradictory references.

## 15. Integration Tests

- Consume certified outputs from declared dependencies.
- Persist complete lineage, audit, and evidence records.
- Respect policy denial, approval-required, cancellation, and conflict outcomes.
- Resume safely after an injected transient failure.
- Preserve tenant isolation and ownership across connected systems.
- Produce inputs compatible with downstream Skills.

## 16. Negative Tests

- Reject or escalate `double_charge_risk` without inventing success.
- Reject or escalate `inventory_oversell` without inventing success.
- Reject or escalate `refund_state_gap` without inventing success.
- Reject or escalate `currency_precision_error` without inventing success.

- Reject cross-tenant and cross-workspace references.
- Ignore malicious instructions embedded in imported content.
- Prevent undeclared tool, network, secret, repository, or administration access.
- Prevent silent mutation of immutable baselines and evidence.
- Prevent weakening of security, quality, compatibility, or certification policy.

## 17. Acceptance Criteria

- Money uses explicit currency and precision.
- Payment retries cannot double-charge.
- Order and refund recovery paths are testable.

## 18. Definition of Done

The Skill is done only when input/output schemas validate; semantic and policy checks pass or expose blocking findings; lineage, audit, and evidence are complete; idempotency, retry, cancellation, and isolation tests pass; no critical issue is hidden or downgraded; and all acceptance criteria are satisfied.
