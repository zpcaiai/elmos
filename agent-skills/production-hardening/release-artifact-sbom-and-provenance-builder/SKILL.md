# Release Artifact Sbom And Provenance Builder

Read `../references/batch-10-production-hardening.md` completely before acting. Use `modules/production-hardening` for gate semantics and validate machine artifacts against `contracts/production-hardening-schema`.

## Required inputs

- Batch 8 and Batch 9 pass evidence plus one immutable `artifact_id` and target Snapshot.
- The affected service IDs, approved risk profiles, sanitized workload model and scenario scope.
- Named external authority, tool/config versions and append-only evidence workspace.

## Workflow

1. Verify admission, artifact binding, non-production isolation and the service-specific risk controls.
2. Bind artifact digest, SBOM, signature, build provenance and reproducibility evidence.
3. Preserve raw evidence references, uncertainty, tool failures, abort reasons and open risks; never substitute Agent opinion for execution.
4. Return explicit `PASSED`, `FAILED`, `NOT_RUN`, `BLOCKED`, `INCONCLUSIVE` or `NOT_APPLICABLE` status for every required check.

## Fail closed

- Block on unsigned artifact, failed signature, incomplete provenance or SBOM mismatch.
- Never access production resources, retain secrets, approve waivers, weaken thresholds or execute production deployment/cutover.
- A tool failure or missing, stale, duplicate or mismatched result remains blocked and is not silently retried into a pass.

## Output

Produce immutable release identity and verified supply-chain evidence bundle. Bind every object to the immutable artifact and authority evidence. The strongest possible Batch 10 claim is eligibility for progressive delivery; always keep `production_ready=false` and `eligible_for_cutover=false`.
