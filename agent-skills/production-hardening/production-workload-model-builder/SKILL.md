# Production Workload Model Builder

Read `../references/batch-10-production-hardening.md` completely before acting. Use `modules/production-hardening` for gate semantics and validate machine artifacts against `contracts/production-hardening-schema`.

## Required inputs

- Batch 8 and Batch 9 pass evidence plus one immutable `artifact_id` and target Snapshot.
- The affected service IDs, approved risk profiles, sanitized workload model and scenario scope.
- Named external authority, tool/config versions and append-only evidence workspace.

## Workflow

1. Verify admission, artifact binding, non-production isolation and the service-specific risk controls.
2. Derive sanitized normal, peak and burst workload models from measured production baselines.
3. Preserve raw evidence references, uncertainty, tool failures, abort reasons and open risks; never substitute Agent opinion for execution.
4. Return explicit `PASSED`, `FAILED`, `NOT_RUN`, `BLOCKED`, `INCONCLUSIVE` or `NOT_APPLICABLE` status for every required check.

## Fail closed

- Block on credentials, personal data, missing provenance or an invented traffic baseline.
- Never access production resources, retain secrets, approve waivers, weaken thresholds or execute production deployment/cutover.
- A tool failure or missing, stale, duplicate or mismatched result remains blocked and is not silently retried into a pass.

## Output

Produce versioned workload models with rate and endpoint, payload and tenant distribution hashes. Bind every object to the immutable artifact and authority evidence. The strongest possible Batch 10 claim is eligibility for progressive delivery; always keep `production_ready=false` and `eligible_for_cutover=false`.
