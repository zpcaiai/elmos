# Test Skill T003: 测试环境、Fixture与数据工厂

## Use this skill when

- Codex must implement, expand, execute, or review strict tests for 测试环境与数据.
- A release claim for Batch 1–37 needs executable evidence rather than prose, screenshots, mocked success, or manually edited status.

## Read first

- `../../../docs/test-suite/IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT.md`
- `../../../docs/test-suite/STRICTNESS_PROFILE.md`
- `../../../docs/test-suite/COVERAGE_POLICY.md`
- `../../../docs/test-suite/EVIDENCE_ANTI_CHEAT.md`
- `../../../test-suites/batch1-37-strict/suite.json`
- `../../../test-suites/batch1-37-strict/strict-profile.json`

## Mandatory invariants

- 环境可重建
- 测试数据无生产秘密
- 时间与随机性可控

## Forbidden shortcuts

- 共享可变环境
- 未版本化Fixture
- 生产数据裸用


## Mandatory case set

This skill owns or validates the following seed cases. Expand them with repository-specific fixtures without weakening their assertions:

- `TS-GOV-03-001`
- `TS-GOV-03-002`
- `TS-GOV-03-003`
- `TS-GOV-03-004`
- `TS-GOV-03-005`
- `TS-GOV-03-006`


## Workflow

1. Inspect the real implementation, contracts, migrations, workflows, permissions, runtime dependencies, existing tests, and evidence paths before editing.
2. Resolve every test to exact Batch capabilities, requirements, source/target artifacts, versions, owners, and risk tiers in the coverage matrix.
3. Materialize deterministic fixtures and an approved isolated environment. Use real compilers, runtimes, databases, browsers, providers, runners, or approved emulators where the case requires them.
4. Implement success, boundary, malformed/unsupported, dependency-failure, authorization, replay/idempotency, version-drift, and evidence-tamper variants.
5. Run the narrowest deterministic tests first, then negative cases, independent holdout cases, representative workloads, and the strict release gate.
6. Store immutable raw evidence before summaries. Bind every result to case ID, source commit, target commit, artifact digest, toolchain, environment, seed, policy and executor identity.
7. Fix product defects at the correct contract, engine, workflow, policy, generator or runtime layer. Do not weaken tests, baselines, masks, tolerances, permissions or evidence rules.
8. Update the coverage matrix, residual-risk register and customer-readable report. Unimplemented or unexecutable cases remain explicit blockers or approved time-bounded waivers.

## Required repository outputs

- Executable tests or harness code for this scope
- Fixtures and environment manifests
- Machine-readable results conforming to `test-result.schema.json`
- Raw immutable evidence and replay instructions
- Coverage links for Batches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37
- Gap and residual-risk records for unsupported cases

## Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/test-suite/validate_test_catalog.py test-suites/batch1-37-strict/cases/catalog.json
python3 scripts/test-suite/validate_coverage_matrix.py test-suites/batch1-37-strict/coverage-matrix.json
python3 scripts/test-suite/run_strict_test_gate.py test-suites/batch1-37-strict
```

Also execute the actual repository build, unit, integration, contract, security, behavior, performance, recovery, holdout and representative commands required by each case. A schema-valid JSON file is not execution evidence.

## Stop and escalate when

- A P0/P1 case cannot run against a real or approved equivalent environment.
- Required source, target, policy, ownership, data, security, performance or rollback facts are unknown.
- Passing requires deleting tests, widening masks/tolerances, auto-updating Golden data, broadening permissions, hiding failed assets, or editing certification status directly.
- A critical failure cannot be deterministically replayed or its evidence chain is incomplete.

## Definition of done

- All owned P0/P1 cases pass under the strict profile, with zero critical unknowns, zero integrity violations and complete immutable evidence.
- Independent holdout and representative cases pass without authoring product fixes from holdout data.
- The strict gate derives the result from raw evidence and cannot be bypassed by editing summary status.
