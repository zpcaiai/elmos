# Runbook: Ai Agent System Audit

## Entry conditions

- An existing canonical route owner has selected `ai-agent-system-audit`.
- The TaskContract, RevisionSet, policy profile, required evidence obligations, and capability lease are valid.
- The workspace and execution environment are owned by the current Turn/Invocation, not by thread-global mutable state.
- Required local dependencies have completed on compatible revisions.

## Procedure

1. Map the complete AI execution and trust graph.
2. Collect representative and adversarial evaluation cases under data-use policy.
3. Run deterministic checks, model-based rubrics, red-team cases, and recovery tests.
4. Measure quality, safety, latency, cost, variance, and intervention by segment.
5. Validate high-risk findings with independent evaluators and runtime evidence.
6. Publish findings, eval gaps, and remediation gates.

## Operational checks

- Emit start, checkpoint, tool-result, policy-decision, artifact, failure, completion, and cancellation telemetry.
- Record model, tool, compiler, database, environment, policy, Skill, Adapter, and artifact versions.
- Keep model/compute/storage/network/license cost separate from human review.
- Report machine wall-clock and queue time; never disguise human elapsed time as machine execution.

## Failure handling

1. Stop new side effects and capture the exact failure boundary.
2. Append the tool result, error, environment state, and affected artifacts to the Evidence/Effect Ledgers.
3. Classify failure as source, environment, dependency, authority, policy, unsupported, unknown, verifier, or external service.
4. Resume only from a valid checkpoint with lossless authority replay and unchanged input identities.
5. Roll back code through atomic revert/workspace discard; compensate data or external effects through the approved route-specific procedure.
6. Escalate material security, data-integrity, irreversible, or customer-impacting failures to human authority.

## Completion handoff

Submit typed outputs, claims, evidence, counterexamples, unknowns, residual risks, and rollback records to an independent verifier. K8 alone records completion/readiness. This runbook does not authorize E4/E5 or production release.
