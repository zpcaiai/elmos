## typed-pure-function-v1

- Status: `supported`
- Strategy: `compiler-backed-semantic-ir`
- Evidence: `certification/local-development-evidence.json`, `certification/local-holdout-evidence.json`, `certification/local-representative-evidence.json`
- Reason: Supported only inside typed-pure-function-v1 after native analysis, target compilation, separate holdout, and representative behavior replay. Independent and external certification remain NOT\_RUN.

## primitive-types

- Status: `supported`
- Strategy: `exact-type-mapping`
- Evidence: `mappings/types.json`
- Reason: Integer, number, boolean, and string are mapped explicitly in the bounded profile.

## if-return-control-flow

- Status: `supported`
- Strategy: `typed-structured-lowering`
- Evidence: `lowering/profile.json`
- Reason: If and return statements are lowered from compiler-backed syntax trees.

## framework-database-async-concurrency

- Status: `blocked`
- Strategy: `separate-exact-pack`
- Evidence: None
- Reason: Requires exact Batch 30/31 packs and independent runtime evidence; it is not hidden in this route.
